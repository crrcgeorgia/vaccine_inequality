  abstract = {Despite the observation that the creation of the Eurasian Economic Union (EEU) appears to have been primarily motivated by a Russian desire to reassert dominance over the region, the question of whether genuine cooperation can take place between the European Union (EU) and the EEU is a relevant one. Russia's economic downturn and the wider regional fallout have significantly eroded the EEU's attractiveness as a motor for economic integration. Moreover, Moscow's tendency to let geopolitics and foreign policy considerations trump economic cooperation causes friction among EEU members. The growing signs that individual EEU states are disillusioned with how membership in the Union has turned out should mean that there will be more willingness on their part to pursue a distinctly multi-vector foreign policy that seeks greater cooperation with both the EU, as well as China. Doing so would also strengthen the EEU member states' ability to form a counterweight to Moscow's dominance of the Eurasian Union, as well as in other areas. Lastly, the lack of funds available from Moscow to drive economic integration also means that domestic reforms in EEU member countries will grow in importance as a motor for positive economic change. Europe and Sweden should consistently seek to emphasise this as part of the Eastern Partnership policy, as well as in their bilateral relations with EEU member states.},

Finding such narrow approaches insufficient for explaining small state behavior, and drawing on liberal and constructivist approaches to international relations theory, the article argues that Georgia's foreign policy orientation has a strong basis in the widespread ideological perception amongst the local political elite that Georgia ``belongs'' in the West. Based on this theoretical framework, this paper provides a historical overview of Georgia's foreign policy, tracing the evolution of Georgia's identity from seeing itself as ``Christian'' in contrast to its Islamic neighbors, to identifying as European in contrast to a modern, Russian ``other''. As Georgia attempts to construct a collective international identity, the devotion to the idea of Euro-Atlantic integration as a ``sacred destiny'' amongst the country's elite has significant foreign policy implications. This article overviews the current challenges and dilemmas of self-identification and investigates the roles that national identity and the prevailing ``European'' identity play in Georgia's quest for ``desovietization''.},

To paint a more nuanced and holistic picture, this article departs from these models and uses content analysis to explore what foreign policy visions political parties present to voters in their manifestos for parliamentary elections between 1992 and 2016. Grounding conclusions in empirical data, the article elaborates a novel analytical framework with two dimensions: alignment and orientation. This framework advances the understanding of foreign policy in two major ways. First, the framework reveals changes in foreign policy behavior that would normally be overlooked. Second, it shows that parties sometimes form pairs of circular foreign policy preferences (i.e., A {$>$} B {$>$} C {$>$} A). An added value of the framework is its potential application to other small states in the post-Soviet space and beyond.},

To a large extent the CU has followed the set-up of the EU, albeit under the institutionalised dominance of Russia. However, many potential CU member states are reluctant to join, especially now, in view of the Crimea crisis. One may ask whether countries are free to join or not join the CU, such freedom being a condition for regional integration.},

  abstract = {As a result of the parliamentary elections of October 2016, a political party with a clear anti-NATO and antiEU political platform made it to the parliament. The Alliance of Patriots was not able to win any majoritarian districts but still managed to receive enough votes to pass the 5\% threshold in the country-wide proportional vote. This contribution looks at foreign policy discourses in post-election Georgia and argues that a possible explanation for the rise of such populist parties can be found in the ambiguous messages coming from the West. To be more precise, as the EU's Eastern Partnership does not offer a membership perspective, it becomes harder for the political elite to sell the pro-European foreign policy agenda to the Georgian public. The issue of the two breakaway territories still remains unresolved, Russia maintains a military presence there, while for the foreseeable future NATO and the EU membership is off the table for Georgia. Hence, in such circumstances, unless substantial progress in relations with the Euro-Atlantic institutions is made, the message of the Alliance of Patriots\textemdash that pro-Western foreign policy endangers Georgia, leaving it to face the Kremlin alone\textemdash could gain more support.},
